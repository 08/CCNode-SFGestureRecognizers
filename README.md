Purpose
--------------

CCNode+SFGestureRecognizers is a category designed to simplify adding UIGestureRecognizers support in cocos2d. 
It removes the need to change cocos2d source code so that you can update your cocos2d anytime new versions are released.

Supported OS & SDK Versions
-----------------------------

* iOS 4.0 (Xcode 4.3, Apple LLVM compiler 3.1)
* cocos2d version 1.x or 2.x works fine.

ARC Compatibility
------------------

Actually version doesn't use ARC, but if you would like it just add an issue on GitHub and I will add it.

Installation
--------------

To use the CCNode+SFGestureRecognizers category in an app, just drag the category files (demo files and assets are not needed) into your project.
Include the CCNode+SFGestureRecognizers.h in your Prefix.pch file so that you can use it everywhere.
